# stack-lab-template
## Stack Lab  
In this lab you will implement a class to model a stack data structure. You may work with others on this lab.

## Set Up
<ol>
	<li>Create new anaconda environment using these commands</li>
	<ul>
		<li>conda create --name stack_lab python=3.13.1</li>
		<li>conda activate stack_lab</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Pull starter code from GitHub Classroom</li>
	<li>Open in VS code and switch to the character_check_lab anaconda environment</li>
	<li>When the lab is complete, push code to GitHub Classroom</li>
</ol>

## Instructions
A stack is a FILO structure (first-in, last-out). Similar to stacking blocks or a deck of cards, the first item on the stack is the last to be retrieved. 

In this lab:
<ol>
  <li>Create a class called Deck that will represent a stack as a deck of cards.</li>
  <li>Create an attribute named cards to keep track of the cards in the deck.</li>
  <li>Create a push method that adds a card to deck of cards.</li>
  <li>Create a pop method that removes a card from the deck of cards.</li>
</ol>
