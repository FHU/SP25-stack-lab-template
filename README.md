## Stack Lab  
This is a group lab.  

A stack is a FILO structure. Similar to stacking blocks or a deck of cards, the first item on the stack is the last to be retrieved. 

In this lab:
1. Create a class called Deck that will represent a stack as a deck of cards.
2. Add any attributes needed to keep track of the cards in the deck.
3. Create a push method that adds a card to deck of cards.
4. Create a pop method that removes a card from the deck of cards.
